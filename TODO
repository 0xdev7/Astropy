Remaining TODOs
===============

- Tick label placement

- More detailed coordinate transformation (currently only FK5 J2000 and
  Galactic)

- Support for multi-dimensional datasets as described in the API document

- Floating axes

- Offset systems

- Start writing tests. Can check for a particular image what tick labels
  are returned by the formatter, etc. (don't necessarily have to compare
  the image directly). But we also need image tests eventually.

- Start writing documentation
