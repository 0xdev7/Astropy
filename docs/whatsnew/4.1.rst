What's New in Astropy 4.1?
**************************

Overview
========

Astropy 4.1 is a major release that contains bug fixes and new features since
the 4.0.x series of releases.

In particular, this release includes:

1. Support for the ``-TAB`` algorithm in FITS WCS as described in
   `WCS Paper III <https://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/scs.pdf>`__ .
   In particular, ``astropy.wcs`` will be able to support ``-TAB`` in WCS if
   already defined in the ``astropy.io.fits.HDUList`` object.

2. Support for units on otherwise unitless models via the ``Model.coerce_units`` method.

3. Added the True Equator Mean Equinox frame.

4. Added the True Equator Mean Equinox frame.

Support for writing Dask arrays to FITS files
=============================================

It is now possible to set the data array for :class:`~astropy.io.fits.PrimaryHDU`
and :class:`~astropy.io.fits.ImageHDU` to a `dask <https://dask.org/>`_ array.
If this is written to disk, the dask array will be computed as it is being
written, which will avoid using excessive memory:

.. doctest-requires:: dask

    >>> import dask.array as da
    >>> array = da.random.random((1000, 1000))
    >>> from astropy.io import fits
    >>> hdu = fits.PrimaryHDU(data=array)
    >>> hdu.writeto('test_dask.fits')

Added True Equator Mean Equinox (TEME) frame for satellite two-line ephemeris data
==================================================================================

The True Equator Mean Equinox (`~astropy.coordinates.TEME`) frame has been added to
the built-in frames within :ref:`astropy.coordinates <astropy-coordinates>`.

For more details, see :ref:`astropy-coordinates-satellites`.
