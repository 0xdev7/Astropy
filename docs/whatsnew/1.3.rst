* xxx distinct people have contributed code

New WCSAxes framework to make Matplotlib plots with WCS coordinates
-------------------------------------------------------------------


New function to contruct RGB images based on Lupton et al. (2004) algorithm
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Change in Table behavior when setting column
--------------------------------------------


Support for Fortran exponent formats in ASCII tables
----------------------------------------------------

The :ref:`fast reader <fast_ascii_io>` in :ref:`io.ascii <io-ascii>` now
supports FORTRAN-style floating point values (i.e. ``1.495978707D+13``), via
the ``fast_reader`` option ``exponent_style``.  The fast reader also now
supports extended precision to fully read fortran outputs. For more details see
:ref:`fortran_style_exponents`.


Serialization of Astropy classes to YAML
----------------------------------------


Performance improvements with lazy-loading in the io.fits sub-package
---------------------------------------------------------------------


.. _whatsnew-1.3-cosmo:

Improvements to cosmology sub-package
-------------------------------------

The default cosmology in the :ref:`astropy-cosmology` sub-package is
now the Planck 2015 cosmology, and the references have been updated
to reflect the published papers.

Improvements to coordinates sub-package
---------------------------------------

The `astropy.coordinates.GCRS` and `astropy.coordinates.PrecessedGeocentric`
frames have been subtly changed such that their ``obsgeoloc`` and ``obsgeovel``
attributes return ``CartesianRepresentation`` objects, rather than ``Quantity``
objects.  This was judged to be an advanced enough use case that this change
will not include a deprecation period (as this would have added substantial
complexity to `astropy.coordinates`). To make code written for earlier versions
compatible with v1.3 and up, simply change all instances of
``<object>.obsgeoloc`` or ``<object>.obsgeovel`` to
``<object>.obsgeoloc.xyz``/``<object>.obsgeovel.xyz``.
