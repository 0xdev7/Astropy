No relativistic species by default in cosmological models
=========================================================
For all of the built in cosmological model types (e.g., FlatLambdaCDM)
the default CMB temperature at z=0 is now 0K, which corresponds to no
contributions from photons or neutrinos (massive or otherwise).  This
does not affect built in literature models (such as the WMAP or Planck
models).  The justification is to avoid including mass-energy components
that the user has not explicitly requested.  This is a non-backwards
compatible change, although the effects are small for most use cases.
