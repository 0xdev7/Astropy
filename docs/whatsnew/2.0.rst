What's New in Astropy 2.0?
**************************

Overview
========

Astropy 2.0 is a major release that adds significant new functionality since
the 1.3.x series of releases.

In particular, this release includes:

* `Easier use of efficient bytestring Table columns in Python 3`_
* A :ref:`new "std_ddof" keyword <whatsnew-2.0-ddof>` option was added
  to :func:`~astropy.stats.sigma_clipped_stats`.

In addition to these major changes, Astropy 2.0 includes a large number of
smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the
:ref:`changelog`. By the numbers:

* xxx issues have been closed since v1.3
* xxx pull requests have been merged since v1.3
* xxx distinct people have contributed code

Easier use of efficient bytestring Table columns in Python 3
============================================================

Working with bytestring Table columns (numpy ``'S'`` dtype) in Python
3 has been made more convenient because it is now possible to compare
and set array elements with the natural Python string (``str``) type.
Previously one had to use the Python ``bytes`` type and bytestring literals
like ``b'hello'``.  This change allows working with ASCII data columns
in Python 3 using only 1-byte per character instead of the default
4-bytes per character for the numpy ``'U'`` unicode dtype.  For large
datasets this improves memory performance.

Please see :ref:`bytestring-columns-python-3` for details.  Note that no
change has been made to behavior for Python 2.

.. note::

     This introduces an API change that affects comparison of
     bytestring column elements in Python 3.

     If comparison with ``str`` instead of ``bytes`` is a problem
     (and ``bytes`` is really more logical), please open an issue
     on GitHub.

No relativistic species by default in cosmological models
=========================================================

For all of the built in cosmological model types (e.g., FlatLambdaCDM)
the default CMB temperature at z=0 is now 0K, which corresponds to no
contributions from photons or neutrinos (massive or otherwise).  This
does not affect built in literature models (such as the WMAP or Planck
models).  The justification is to avoid including mass-energy components
that the user has not explicitly requested.  This is a non-backwards
compatible change, although the effects are small for most use cases.

Cone search module (``astropy.vo.conesearch``) moved to astroquery
==================================================================

The cone search module has been moved to `Astroquery
<http://astroquery.readthedocs.io>`_ (0.3.5 and later) and will be removed from
Astropy in a future version. The API here will be preserved as "classic" API in
Astroquery, however some configuration behavior might change; See the Astroquery
documentation for new usage details.

SAMP module moved to `astropy.samp`
===================================

The SAMP (Simple Application Messaging Protocol) module, formerly available
in ``astropy.samp``, has now been moved to `astropy.samp`, so you should
update any imports to this module.

.. _whatsnew-2.0-ddof:

New ``std_ddof`` keyword to :func:`~astropy.stats.sigma_clipped_stats`
======================================================================

A new ``std_ddof`` keyword option was added to
:func:`~astropy.stats.sigma_clipped_stats`.  This keyword represents
the delta degrees of freedom for the standard deviation calculation.
Specifically, the divisor used in the calculation is ``N - std_ddof``,
where ``N`` represents the number of array elements.  The ``std_ddof``
default value is zero.
