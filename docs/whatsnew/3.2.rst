.. _whatsnew-3.2-timeseries:

New Sub-package for Time Series
===============================

Astropy 3.2 includes a new experimental sub-package: :ref:`astropy-timeseries`.
Currently this sub-package provides classes to represent sampled and binned
time series as well as some basic analysis tasks.

The following example shows a simple example of reading in a Kepler light curve,
finding the period of the transits, and folding the light curve.

.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context: reset

   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from astropy.timeseries import TimeSeries
   from astropy.utils.data import get_pkg_data_filename
   from astropy import units as u

   filename = get_pkg_data_filename('timeseries/kplr010666592-2009131110544_slc.fits')
   ts = TimeSeries.read(filename, format='kepler.fits')

   plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))

   # Show the original light curve
   plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
   plt.plot(ts.time.mjd, ts['sap_flux'], 'k.', markersize=1)
   plt.xlabel('Barycentric Modified Julian Date')
   plt.ylabel('SAP Flux (e-/s)')

   # Find the transit period and fold the light curve
   periodogram = ts.periodogram(algorithm='bls', column='sap_flux')
   results = periodogram.autopower(0.2 * u.day)
   best = np.argmax(results.power)
   ts_folded = ts.fold(period=results.period[best],
                       midpoint_epoch=results.transit_time[best])

   # Show the folded light curve
   plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
   plt.plot(ts_folded.time.jd, ts_folded['sap_flux'], 'k.', markersize=1)
   plt.xlabel('Time relative to epoch (days)')
   plt.gca().get_yaxis().set_visible(False)

This sub-package should be considered experimental and subject to API changes in
the future if user feedback calls for it.

Note that the :class:`~astropy.timeseries.LombScargle` and
:class:`~astropy.timeseries.BoxLeastSquares` periodogram classes have now moved
from the :mod:`astropy.stats` to the :mod:`astropy.timeseries` module.

Changes to Ecliptic Transformations
===================================

Placeholder. gist is that True/Mean are now treated appropriately, but this
might change code from older versions (no good way to do deprecation)
