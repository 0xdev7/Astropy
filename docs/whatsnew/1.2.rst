Automatic updates to IERS Earth rotation data
---------------------------------------------

The `astropy.utils.iers` sub-package provides access to the tables provided by
the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems (IERS) service.  These
are used in `astropy.time` to tranform to/from UT1 values and for determining
Earth orientation for celestional-to-terrestrial coordinate transformations (in
`astropy.coordinates`).

Starting with astropy 1.2, the latest IERS values (which include approximately
one year of predictive values) are automatically downloaded from the IERS
service when required.  This happens when a time or coordinate transformation
needs a value which is not already available via the download cache.

For details see the `astropy.utils.iers` sub-package documentation.
