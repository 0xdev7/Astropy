What's New in Astropy 1.2?
==========================

Overview
--------

Astropy 1.2 is a major release that adds significant new functionality since
the 1.1.x series of releases.

In particular, this release includes:

*
*
*

In addition to these major changes, Astropy 1.2 includes a large number of
smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the
:ref:`changelog`. By the numbers:

* ??? issues have been closed since v1.1
* ??? pull requests have been merged since v1.1
* ??? distinct people have contributed code

Solar system ephemerides
------------------------



Astrometric coordinate frames
-----------------------------



Lomb-scargle periodograms
-------------------------



Other new statistics features
-----------------------------

* The Jackknife resampling method is available in astropy.stats.jackknife.
  Jackknife resampling generates n deterministic samples of size n-1 from
  a measured sample of size n. Those samples can then be used for various
  statistics estimation such as variance and bias.
* Circular statistics (circular mean, variance, etc) are provided in
  astropy.stats.circstats. The API basically follows the same conventions of
  R CircStats package. In addition, the circular stats are compatible with
  astropy.units.Quantity.
* Akaike and Bayesian information criterions are implemented in
  astropy.stats.info_theory. Basically, these information criterions are used
  to decided whether increasing the number of parameters in a model truly
  improves the fitting. Conversely, they are also used to verify whether
  improvements in fitting are due to the increasing of the number of
  parameters.


Apparent/absolute bolometric magnitudes and other new units
-----------------------------------------------------------



Zscale implementation
---------------------



NDData improvements
-------------------



Automatic updates to IERS Earth rotation data
---------------------------------------------

The `astropy.utils.iers` sub-package provides access to the tables provided by
the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems (IERS) service.  These
are used in `astropy.time` to tranform to/from UT1 values and for determining
Earth orientation for celestional-to-terrestrial coordinate transformations (in
`astropy.coordinates`).

Starting with astropy 1.2, the latest IERS values (which include approximately
one year of predictive values) are automatically downloaded from the IERS
service when required.  This happens when a time or coordinate transformation
needs a value which is not already available via the download cache.

For details see the `astropy.utils.iers` sub-package documentation.

Other significant changes
-------------------------

Astropy now requires Numpy 1.7.0 or later.
