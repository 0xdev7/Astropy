Solar system ephemerides
------------------------

Positions of the major solar-system bodies, including the moon, can now be
calculated.  These integrate with the coordinates subpackage, allowing use of
apparent (e.g. ``AltAz``) positions or barycentric values.  These can be
calculated using either using built-in approximations or more precisely 
using JPL ephemeris models (the latter requiring the ``jplephem`` package).
For more details, see :ref:`astropy-coordinates-solarsystem`.

Barycentric light-travel time corrections
-----------------------------------------

The :class:`~astropy.time.Time` class has gained a new method
:meth:`~astropy.time.Time.light_travel_time` for calculating barycentric
(or heliocentric) corrections. For more details, see 
:ref:`time-light-travel-time`.

Astrometric coordinate frames
-----------------------------



Lomb-scargle periodograms
-------------------------



Other new statistics features
-----------------------------



Apparent/absolute bolometric magnitudes and other new units
-----------------------------------------------------------



Zscale implementation
