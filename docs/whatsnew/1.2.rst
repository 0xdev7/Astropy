Solar system ephemerides
------------------------



Astrometric coordinate frames
-----------------------------



Lomb-scargle periodograms
-------------------------



Other new statistics features
-----------------------------



Apparent/absolute bolometric magnitudes and other new units
-----------------------------------------------------------



Zscale implementation
---------------------

The `zscale <http://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=134139>`_ algorithm
from IRAF is now included in Astropy's :doc:`visualization
<../visualization/normalization>` sub-package, and available as
a `~astropy.visualization.ZScaleInterval` interval class. The implementation is
based on `Numdisplayâ€™s <http://stsdas.stsci.edu/numdisplay/>`_ one, slightly
modified to expose more arguments and work with data with any number of
dimensions.

NDData improvements
-------------------



Automatic updates to IERS Earth rotation data
---------------------------------------------

The `astropy.utils.iers` sub-package provides access to the tables provided by
the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems (IERS) service.  These
are used in `astropy.time` to tranform to/from UT1 values and for determining
Earth orientation for celestional-to-terrestrial coordinate transformations (in
`astropy.coordinates`).

Starting with astropy 1.2, the latest IERS values (which include approximately
one year of predictive values) are automatically downloaded from the IERS
service when required.  This happens when a time or coordinate transformation
needs a value which is not already available via the download cache.

For details see the `astropy.utils.iers` sub-package documentation.
