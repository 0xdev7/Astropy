`~astropy.units.add_unit_aliases` has been added, which provides an alternative
to using `~astropy.units.UnrecognizedUnit` or defining additional units. See
:ref:`astropy-units-format-unrecognized_` for more details, but the following
simple example should be enough to get started with::

    >>> import astropy.units as u
    >>> with u.add_unit_aliases({"Angstroem": u.Angstrom}):
    >>>     u.Unit("Angstroem", parse_strict="raise") == u.Angstrom
