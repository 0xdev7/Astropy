============

This example is based on fixing `Issue 1829 <https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/1829>`_ from the list of GitHub issues.

mwcraig: I WILL DO THIS IF IT SEEMS USEFUL...my thought is to provide a
complete, step-by-step example of how to make a branch, stage commits, etc,
omitting only the actual editing.

It would include using ``git status`` and ``git diff`` to see what has
changed, as in the 0.3 
`developer workflow <http://astropy.readthedocs.org/en/stable/development/workflow/development_workflow.html#in-more-detail>`_

A link can be provided to the pull request so that one can see an example of
how all of this looks after the pull request is submitted/accepted. If there
is a different issue it would be better to use, let me know.
