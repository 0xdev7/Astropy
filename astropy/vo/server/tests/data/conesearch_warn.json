            "description": "This table contains the catalog of X-ray sources detected by the two Wide Field Cameras (WFCs) in complete observations on board BeppoSAX during its 6 years of operational lifetime, i.e., between April 1996 and April 2002. The BeppoSAX WFCs were coded mask instruments sensitive in the 2 - 28 keV energy band with a 40 x 40 square degree fields of view, pointing in opposite directions and perpendicularly to the BeppoSAX Narrow Field Instruments (NFI). The WFCs were usually operated simultaneously to NFI observations, each lasting up to several days. The WFCs observed thus the entire sky several times with a typical sensitivity of 2 to 10 mCrab. A systematic analysis of all WFC observations in the BeppoSAX archive has been carried out using the latest post-mission release of the WFC analysis software and calibrations. The catalog includes 253 distinct sources, obtained from a total sample of 8253 WFC detections.\n\nThis particular record describes access to the position-based catalog data in this collection through the VO-standard ConeSearch service interface.  It can be used automatically by compliant tools and applications.",

            "description": "This database table comprises the 4th BATSE Gamma-Ray Burst Catalog, hereafter referred to as 4B. It specifies the locations and times for 1637 triggered gamma-ray bursts observed from 19 April, 1991 until 29 August, 1996. It therefore includes the data from the 3B catalog. The only revisions from the 3B catalog are improved locations for the trigger #s 741, 2311, and 3155. Bursts since the end of the 1B catalog (March 1992) occurred when the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) tape recorders were experiencing numerous errors. Consequently, there are gaps in the data of many bursts that preclude valid measurement of peak flux, peak rate, fluence, or duration. Peak rates on the 1 second timescale from each detector are almost always available. These data (called MAXBC rates) can be used to determine burst location. Previous difficulties with this data type have been largely removed, and we now believe that the systematic errors for MAXBC-located bursts are the same as for bursts located with other data types. It is still true however, that the MAXBC-located bursts usually have larger statistical errors than would be the case if another data type were available. The parameter called comments_position in this database contains comments on MAXBC-located bursts. A number of CGRO and BATSE flight software changes have significantly reduced the problem of data gaps since March of 1993. Much additional material about the BATSE 4B Catalog can be found on the Compton Observatory Science Support Center website at &lt;pre&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/batse/4Bcatalog/\"&gt;http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/batse/4Bcatalog/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; including some supporting tabular material: (i) An Exposure Table which describes the average exposure time as a function of declination for burst detection, (ii) a Trigger Efficiency Table which describes the fraction of time a burst will be triggered on each of the trigger timescales, as a function of the burst intensity, and (iii) a Trigger Criteria History Table which lists the trigger thresholds and the channels used for triggering as functions both of time and trigger number.\n\nThis particular record describes access to the position-based catalog data in this collection through the VO-standard ConeSearch service interface.

The sample was selected from the complete set of 2704 BATSE GRBs based on their energy fluence or peak photon flux values in order to assure good statistics, and included 17 short GRBs. To obtain well-constrained spectral parameters, several photon models were used to fit each spectrum. Spectral parameters resulting from the fits using different models were compared, and the spectral parameters that best represent each spectrum were statistically determined, taking into account the parameterization differences among the models. A thorough analysis was performed on 350 time-integrated and 8459 time-resolved burst spectra, and the effects of integration times in determining the spectral parameters were explored. Using the results, correlations among spectral parameters and their evolution pattern within each burst were studied. The resulting spectral catalog provides reliable constraints on particle acceleration and emission mechanisms in GRBs, and is the most comprehensive study of spectral properties of GRB prompt emission to date. The files containing the details of the spectral model fits to the GRBs are also available as data products associated with this Browse table.\n\nThis particular record describes access to the position-based catalog data in this collection through the VO-standard ConeSearch service interface.

            "description": "The ChaMP Extended Stellar Survey (ChESS) X-ray catalog contains 348 X-ray-emitting stars identified from correlating the Extended Chandra Multiwavelength Project (ChaMP), a wide-area serendipitous survey based on archival X-ray images, with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The authors used morphological star/galaxy separation, matching to an SDSS quasar catalog, an optical color-magnitude cut, and X-ray data-quality tests to create this catalog, from a sample of 2121 matched ChaMP/SDSS sources. Their cuts retain 92% of the spectroscopically confirmed stars in the original sample while excluding 99.6% of the 684 spectroscopically confirmed extragalactic sources. Fewer than 3% of the sources in their final catalog are previously identified stellar X-ray emitters. For 42 catalog members, spectroscopic classifications are available in the literature. New spectral classifications and H-alpha measurements are presented for an additional 79 stars. The catalog is dominated by main-sequence stars; the authors estimate the fraction of giants in ChESS to be ~10%. They identify seven giant stars (including a possible Cepheid and an RR Lyrae star) as ChaMP sources, as well as three cataclysmic variables. They derive distances from ~10 to 2000 pc for the stars in the catalog using photometric parallax relations appropriate for dwarfs on the main sequence and calculate their X-ray and bolometric luminosities. These stars lie in a unique space in the L_X-distance plane, filling the gap between the nearby stars identified as counterparts to sources in the ROSAT All Sky Survey and the more distant stars detected in deep Chandra and XMM-Newton surveys. For 36 newly identified X-ray-emitting M stars, the authors calculated L_H-alpha/L_bol. The quantities L_H-alpha/L_bol and L_X/L_bol are linearly related below L_X/L_bol ~ 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;, while L_H-alpha/L_bol appears to turn over at larger L_X/L_bol values. Stars with reliable SDSS photometry have an ~0.1 mag blue excess in u-g, likely due to increased chromospheric continuum emission. Photometric metallicity estimates suggest that the sample is evenly split between the young and old disk populations of the Galaxy; the lowest activity sources belong to the old disk population, a clear signature of the decay of magnetic activity with age.\n\nThis particular record describes access to the position-based catalog data in this collection through the VO-standard ConeSearch service interface.

            "description": "Eleven lists of blue stellar objects (BSOs) found in the First Byurakan Survey (FBS) low-dispersion spectroscopic plates were published in the journal Astrophysics in the period 1990-1996, The selection was carried out in the region with declinations +33 deg. &lt; delta &lt; +45 deg. and delta &gt; +61 degrees with a surface area of 4000 square degrees. As a result, the present catalog of the FBS blue stellar objects (BSOs) has been compiled. Its preliminary version has been available at CDS since 1999. The author has revised and updated the FBS BSOs catalog with the new data from recently published optical and multiwavelength catalogues to give access to all available data and make further comparative studies of the properties of these objects possible. The athor has made cross-correlations of the FBS BSOs catalog with the MAPS , USNO-B1.0, SDSS, and 2MASS catalogs, as well as with ROSAT, IRAS, NVSS, and FIRST catalogs , added updated SIMBAD and NED data for the objects, and provided accurate DSS1 and DSS2 positions and revised photometry. The author also checked the objects for proper motion and variability. A refined classification for the low-dispersion spectra in the Digitized First Byurakan Survey (DFBS) was carried out. The revised and updated catalog of 1103 FBS blue stellar objects is presented here. (The catalog in fact contains 1101 objects, as 2 pairs of objects turned to be identical; however, the author has kept all objects in the list on order to allow users to enter and find objects by all accepted FBS names). The FBS blue stellar objects catalog can be used to study a complete sample of white dwarfs, hot subdwarfs, horizantla-branch B (HBB) stars, cataclysmic variables, bright AGN, and to investigate individual interesting objects.\n\nThis particular record describes access to the position-based catalog data in this collection through the VO-standard ConeSearch service interface.

Of the 6371 SDSS DR3 quasars covered by 204 GALEX GR1 tiles and listed in this table, 5380 (84%) have near-UV detections, while 3034 (48%) have both near-UV and far-UV detections using a matching radius of 7 arcseconds. Most of the DR3 sample quasars are detected in the near-UV until z ~ 1.7, with the near-UV detection fraction dropping to ~50% by z ~ 2. Statistical tests performed on the distributions of nondetections indicate that the optically selected quasars missed in the UV tend to be optically faint or at high redshift. The GALEX positions are shown to be consistent with the SDSS astrometry to within an rms scatter of 0.6 - 0.7 arcsecs in each coordinate, and the empirically determined photometric errors from multiepoch GALEX observations significantly exceed the Poissonian errors quoted in the GR1 object catalogs. The UV-detected quasars are well separated from stars in UV-optical color-color space, with the UV-optical relative colors suggesting a marginally detected population of reddened objects due to absorption along the line of sight or dust associated with the quasar. The resulting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) cover ~350 - 9000 Angstroms (rest frame), where the overall median SED peaks near the Lyman-Alpha emission line, as found in other UV quasar studies. The large sample size allows the authors to construct median SEDs in small bins of redshift and luminosity, and they find that the median SED becomes harder (bluer) at UV wavelengths for quasars with lower continuum luminosity. The detected UV-optical flux as a function of redshift is qualitatively consistent with attenuation by intervening Lyman-absorbing clouds.\n\nThis particular record describes access to the position-based catalog data in this collection through the VO-standard ConeSearch service interface.

            "description": "This table contains the results of a deep X-ray survey conducted with XMM-Newton, centered on the UK ROSAT 13-hours deep field area. This region covers 0.18 square degrees, and is the first of the two areas covered with XMM-Newton as part of an extensive multi-wavelength survey designed to study the nature and evolution of the faint X-ray source population. This table contains the final catalog of 225 sources. Within the central 9 arcminutes, 68% of the source positions are accurate to 2 arcseconds, making optical follow-up relatively straightforward. The authors construct the N(&gt;S) relation in four energy bands: 0.2-0.5, 0.5-2, 2-5 and 5-10 keV. In all but the highest energy band, they find that the source counts can be represented by a double power law with a bright-end slope consistent with the Euclidean case and a break around 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Below this flux, the counts exhibit a flattening. The 13-hours deep field is centered on the sky coordinates RA(J2000) = 13 34 37.1, Dec (J2000) = +37 53 02.2. The XMM-Newton observations were carried out in three separate revolutions during June 2001 for a total exposure time of 200ks. Approximately 40% of the total observation time was affected by high particle background flares, arising from soft protons hitting the detector. The data were therefore temporally filtered to remove these high-background periods. Filtering reduced the total useful exposure time from ~200 ks to ~120 ks.\n\nThis particular record describes access to the position-based catalog data in this collection through the VO-standard ConeSearch service interface.

This catalog contains 792 SDSS DR5 quasars with optical spectra that have been observed serendipitously in the X-rays with XMM-Newton. These quasars cover a redshift range of z = 0.11 - 5.41 and a magnitude range of i = 15.3 - 20.7. Substantial numbers of radio-loud (70) and broad absorption line (51) quasars exist within this sample. Significant X-ray detections at &gt;=2 sigma account for 87% of the sample (685 quasars), and 473 quasars are detected at &gt;=6 sigma, sufficient to allow X-ray spectral fits. For detected sources, ~60% have X-ray fluxes between F(2-10 keV) = (1-10) x 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; erg cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The authors fit a single power law, a fixed power law with intrinsic absorption left free to vary, and an absorbed power-law model to all quasars with X-ray signal-to-noise ratio &gt;= 6, resulting in a weighted mean photon index Gamma = 1.91 +/- 0.08, with an intrinsic dispersion sigma(Gamma) = 0.38. For the 55 sources (11.6%) that prefer intrinsic absorption, the authors find a weighted mean N_H = 1.5 +/- 0.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. They find that Gamma correlates significantly with optical color, Delta(g-i), the optical-to-X-ray spectral index (alpha_ox), and the X-ray luminosity. While the first two correlations can be explained as artifacts of undetected intrinsic absorption, the correlation between Gamma and X-ray luminosity appears to be a real physical correlation, indicating a pivot in the X-ray slope.\n\nThis particular record describes access to the position-based catalog data in this collection through the VO-standard ConeSearch service interface.

There is an increase of 28,354 entries over the previous edition. The catalog consists of the SDSS objects that have luminosities larger than an absolute i-magnitude M_i = -22.0 (in a cosmology with H_0 = 70 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, Omega_M = 0.3, and Omega_Lambda = 0.7), have at least one emission line with a FWHM larger than 1000 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; or have interesting/complex absorption features, are fainter than an apparent i magnitude ~ 15.0, and have highly reliable redshifts. The area covered by the catalog is ~ 9380 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The quasar redshifts range from 0.065 to 5.46, with a median value of 1.49; the catalog includes 1248 quasars at redshifts greater than 4, of which 56 are at redshifts greater than 5. The catalog contains 9210 quasars with i &lt; 18; slightly over half of the entries have i &lt; 19. For each object the catalog presents positions accurate to better than 0.1\" rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 magnitudes, and information on the morphology and selection method. The catalog also contains basic radio, near-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800-9200 Angstroms at a spectral resolution of ~ 2000; the spectra can be retrieved from the SDSS public database using the information provided in the catalog. Over 96% of the objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS.
